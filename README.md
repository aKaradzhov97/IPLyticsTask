<b><i>IPLytics</i></b>
<b>How to run this project:</b>
Simply run <b>index.js</b> using Webstorm or another IDE.
I have added the required functionality, with some validations BUT NOT ALL,
because validations were not required.

Basically that's everything. I hope I have understood the requirements properly.
